Grimsby Town Football Club entered the 2009 10 as a member of Football League Two for the 6th season on the trot. The club are still aiming to leave Blundell Park within the next few seasons. Manager Mike Newell brought in eight players in the close season four of which were on loan at the club the previous season he also released eight players the club also offered four contracts to youth team members. Manager Mike Newell also gave new contracts to midfielders Jamie Clarke and Danny Boshell. Also in the close season Assistant Manager Stuart Watkiss did not have his contract renewed and he joined Hull City as Development Coach and Brian Stein who was chief scout took on the responsibilities of Stuart Watkiss.   == Fixtures and results ==   === Pre season matches ===   ==== South West Challenge Cup ====   ==== Lincolnshire Cup ====   ==== Friendlies ==== Mike Newell took Grimsby Town to the 2009 South West Challenge Cup in Devon in which the rules allowed him to make ten changes in each match which he did on each occasion. They started off strong in pre-season with a one-nil win against Belgian side R.R.F.C. Montegn e with a late free kick from Jamie Clarke. They then played in a five-goal thriller against Yeovil Town in which Grimsby Town won 3 2 with Barry Conlon Danny North Nathan Arnold all scoring going on to reach the semi-final and finishing top of their group. Then continuing their strong form they beat Rushden & Diamonds 4 1 with Adrian Forbes Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro Nathan Arnold Danny North all scoring putting them into the final. After reaching the Final they had to withdraw on the grounds that they could not agree a kick-off time with their opponents Luton Town in which there would be police at the ground providing protection for the fans as fans' safety concerns had been expressed earlier in the tournament. During the 2009 South West Challenge Cup Mike Newell named two trialists in his 23-man squad who were Nathan Arnold from Mansfield Town in which he impressed by scoring two goals and he also named Swansea City striker Chris Jones in his squad although he didn't score he impressed enough to be offered a contract. Also joining for their last match defender Sol Davis from Luton Town joined up for a trial. On their return home they faced Scunthorpe United in the Lincolnshire Senior Cup Semi-Final in which they were beaten by a strong Scunthorpe United side 3 0 after Mike Newell fielded a weakened team. Their next opponents were Leeds United in which they drew 1 1 in front of a big crowd after Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro had put them in the lead in the first half. They faced Stockport County in their next pre-season match and were beaten one-nil they were without skipper Ryan Bennett Rob Atkinson and Danny North in a well worked play eight minutes into the second half Poole slotted the ball under Grimsby's Nick Colgan. Both Nick Hegarty and Nathan Jarman had good chances to score but were denied by Stockport County's defence. In the second half of the match Stockport County's Matty Mainwaring went off with two fractures to his leg after a tackle from Michael Leary new striker Chris Jones came on for Nick Hegarty. In their last pre-season friendly Grimsby played Northern Counties East Premier League side Winterton Rangers the Mariners were the dominant force throughout the game with Barry Conlon grabbing a first half hat-trick in under twenty-five minutes after his first goal after eight minutes and completed his hat-trick twenty five minutes later with a Nathan Jarman goal after his second. Winterton Rangers scored through Gary Jones after he spotted Leigh Overton off his line and chipping it into the back of the net. Nathan Jarman coming off in the first half with a suspected broken toe which was later confirmed along with a broken metatarsal. In the second half the manager changing his squad totally with the exception of the keeper and Chris Jones who came on for the injured Nathan Jarman in the second half Akpa Akpro scoring four after he walked through the defence Danny North scored a brace after chipping the keeper twice and nearly grabbing his hat-trick only for his effort to be tipped onto the bar but he later set up Michael Leary for a tap in. Clarke scored his second free kick. Grimsby had left sided Watford player Louis Lavers on trial who started in the first half in left back but moved to the left side of midfield in the second half on the 75th minute Grimsby brought on 14-year-old Jack Barlow from the youth-team.   === Football League Two ===   === FA Cup ===   === League Cup ===   === Football League Trophy === Grimsby received a bye into the second round of the competition in the Northern Section. Due to the new way of determining which teams received byes into the second round of the competition the teams who received a bye last season will not receive a bye two seasons in succession the byes are now determined by recommendation at club meetings.   == League table == Notts County's season mostly made the headlines for all the wrong reasons as they were involved in an abortive high-spending takeover by a consortium who bought in Sven-G ran Eriksson as Director of Football and got through four managers during the course of the season. However they managed to shake off their off-field problems and won the title. Bournemouth continued their revival under Eddie Howe and won promotion in the runners-up spot. The last automatic promotion spot was won by Rochdale who were promoted for the first time since 1969 Dagenham and Redbridge won the play-offs reaching the 2nd tier of the Football League for the first time in their 18-year history. Darlington were unable to recover from losing many of their players during their spell in administration at the end of the previous season and were relegated in bottom place becoming only the third club after Halifax Town and Chester City to be relegated to the Football Conference on two separate occasions. Grimsby suffered the relegation that they only avoided the previous year due to Luton Town's points deduction; their form improved significantly in the final weeks of the season but they were ultimately undone by a run of nearly five months without a win earlier in the season and were relegated to the Blue Square Premier after losing on the final day of the season.   == Coaching staff ==   === Appearances and goals ===   === Loaned out player stats ===   === Most frequent starting line-up ===  Most frequent starting line-up uses the team's most used formation: 4 4 2. The players used are those who have played the most games in each respective position not necessarily who have played most games out of all the players.   === Scorers ===   == Transfers ==   === In ===   ==== Pre-Season ====   ==== Mid Season ====   === Out ===   ==== Pre-Season ====   ==== Mid Season ====   == Trialists == Manager Mike Newell took two of the trialists Nathan Arnold Chris Jones in his 23-man squad to the 2009 South West Challenge Cup and defender Sol Davis joined up with the squad mini way through the 2009 South West Challenge Cup and was given 45 minutes to impress. Before the 2009 South West Challenge Cup Mike Newell had a number of strikers on trial but none of them were offered a contract. Although not scoring Chris Jones impressed enough to be offered a contract by the club and which was later accepted.   === Pre-Season ===   === Mid-Season ===   == References ==
Isis is an American comic book character based on the goddess of the same name from Ancient Egyptian religion. Originally published by Image Comics she has since been moved to her creator Darren G. Davis's publication of Bluewater Productions. Originally published in February 2002 in a one-shot issue by Image Comics Isis later appeared in The 10th Muse #10 and The Odyssey #1 - both by Tidal Wave Studios and Avatar Press. In 2005 Isis would return in her own ongoing monthly series The Legend of Isis at Alias Enterprises by creator Darren G. Davis and writer Ryan Scott Ottney before the last move to Bluewater. Although some artistic depictions of the character such as that shown in the comic illustration at right make her resemble the DC Comics superhero and TV character of the same name the Image/Bluewater version has no connection.   == Fictional character biography == Once a powerful warrior in Ancient Egypt Isis fought in honorable battle with her sister Nephtys. The victor of the battle would be wed to Osiris and welcomed into the Egyptian Pantheon as its Queen Goddess. Isis defeated her sister but spared her life. Nephtys and her brother Set the advisor to the throne devised an evil spell that cast Isis 5000 years into the future and erased her from everyone's thoughts and minds. Isis arrives in modern day Los Angeles California and quickly draws the attention of the local police. Officer Scott Dean feeling sorry for her takes her into his care. Isis realizes that she has been erased from history and Nephtys now sits next to Osiris in Egyptian Mythology. She finds the Staff of Luxor at a local museum and says that it was pulling her to it. Once Isis is near this staff she is empowered with great abilities by the spirit of Osiris who now channels his power through the staff and into her hands. The staff also enables her with complete fluency in English. But touching the Staff also awakens the spirit of Set who is now an evil demi-god. Set has come back to destroy Isis so that he may complete his agreement with the Goddess Nephtys and be granted the full power of the God of Chaos and rule the world. Scott with the help of Crystal Van Howe Scott's girlfriend create a new identity for Isis to live in the modern world and name her Jessica Eisen. "Jessica" takes on a job at a museum of Egyptian artifacts.   == Characters ==   === Osiris === Osiris was very much in love with the warrior Isis in his time but an evil spell cast upon him by his advisor Set caused him and everyone else to forget that Isis ever existed as they cast her far into the future. Without remembering Isis Osiris wed her sister Nephtys instead. Years later Nepytys and Set would devise a plot to kill Osiris giving all power of Egypt to Nephtys. As Set carried out their plan he told Osiris what they had done to Isis. In this moment the spell over Osiris was lifted and he remembered everything. He used his last dying breath to enchant the Staff of Luxor with the power of his spirit. With his power contained within the staff would seek out Isis wherever she may be so that the two could be together someday and use this power to destroy the evil that tore them apart.   === Jessica Eisen === Jessica Eisen is the name chosen by Scott Dean for the Egyptian Goddess Isis to adopt while living in our time - named after Scott's mother See: The Legend of Isis #1 2005. Jessica lives a quiet life in Los Angeles California where she works in a museum tending to many ancient artifacts from around the globe. Her specialty is of course Egyptian culture.   === Other villains === Lynx is the spirit of the Amazonian Goddess Sekhent who has inhabited the body of Crystal Van Howe through a mystic gem. Crystal was at first completely unaware of her possession and she has no control over the evil spirit that erupts from within. Lynx wishes to enslave or kill all the men of the world and usher in a matriarchal dominant society. Lynx first appeared in The Legend of Isis #1 Alias Enterprises 2005. Wosret is the leader of the ancient secret religion known as the Council of Isis. The Council believes that Osiris prophesied to them the return of Isis and they believe that Isis will lead them to destroy all "false" worldly-religions to re-establish the Egyptian Pantheon as our true and rightful gods. The Council uses a mind-altering chemical-gas to enslave people and abduct them to join their religion. The gas has a particularly violent effect on those thought to be more resistant to the Egyptian gods and transforms their entire body into vicious hideous dog-like creatures See: Anubis. When Scott and Crystal unleashed the chemical-antidote on the Council its servants began to return to normal. When Isis tried the antidote on Wosret however he reverted to his original form; a massive giant Dog-like creature more vicious and deadly than any of the others. Wosret once believed that Isis was the fulfillment of the great prophecy but since she destroyed his religion he now believes she is a false-Isis. Wosret is intent on destroying this false-Isis as he continues to await the arrival of the "true" Isis. Wosret was created by writer Ryan Scott Ottney and first appeared in The Legend of Isis #6 Alias Enterprises 2006. The name Wosret translates to "Beautiful Isis". Silencer is a deadly female assassin who never speaks once hired to kill a colleague of Isis' named Judo Girl. Judo Girl secretly replaced Silencer to infiltrate a mob boss circle and had to fight Isis and Atlas who were unaware that this was not Silencer but rather Judo Girl in disguise. Silencer later returned in the pages of Judo Girl comics. Silencer was created by writer Ryan Scott Ottney and first appeared in The Legend of Isis #5 Alias Enterprises 2006.   == Other media == In 2004 The Legend of Isis was optioned for a major motion picture by Paramount Studios and Grammnet Productions with screenwriter Ali Russell.   == Notes ==   == References ==   == External links == Bluewater Productions Alias Comics Devil's Due Digital - Digital distributor.
Pandrosos also known as Pandrosus is known in Greek myth as one of the three daughters of Kekrops the first king of Athens along with her sisters Aglauros and Herse. The three of them together are often referred to collectively as the Kekropidai after their father.   == Pandrosos in mythology == Kekrops is thought to have been born from the soil of Athens itself and possesses the head and torso of a man and the lower body of a snake. Beyond his status as Athens  first king he is known for judging the contest between Poseidon and Athena that decided the naming and patronage of the city. However following his death Kekrops is not succeeded by his son but rather by Erechtheus also known by the name Erichthonios the child of Hephaestus and Gaia. As told by the Bibliotheca the god Hephaestus in a fit of passion attempts to rape the virgin goddess Athena but is unsuccessful. In vain pursuit he ejaculates on the Acropolis and his seed fertilizes the soil there impregnating Gaia and leading to the birth of Erechtheus. After Erechtheus is born Athena takes the baby into her care and places him into a chest or in some versions of the story a basket. She entrusts the chest to the Kekropidai warning them never to look inside. While Pandrosos faithfully follows Athena s instructions Aglauros and Herse are compelled by curiosity to open the chest provoking Athena's wrath. The two disobedient sisters are driven mad when they see the contents of the chest in some versions of the myth they see Erechtheus being guarded by a giant snake; in others they see Erechtheus himself in the form of a snake and hurl themselves off of the northern slope of the Acropolis falling to their deaths. As the dutiful sister Pandrosos is spared her sisters  unfortunate fates. There are several other versions of the myth of the Kekropidai. They generally disagree with one another on the topic of which of the sisters carries the blame for opening the chest. In one version all three sisters are equally culpable and Pandrosos succumbs to the temptation to look inside the chest along with her sisters. Another version of the myth holds Aglauros and Pandrosos as blameworthy with Herse taking on the role of Pandrosos as the innocent sister. Yet another version tells the tale that Aglauros alone opened the chest and that Pandrosos and Herse were spared Athena s wrath for dutifully following the goddess  instructions.   == Etymology == The name "Pandrosos" carries the meaning of "all dew" or "all bedewed" in the Greek language drosos dew. For this reason Pandrosos is at times called the "Dew Goddess" and the three Kekropidai together are sometimes referred to as the "Dew Sisters." Interestingly the name "Herse" also holds connotations of dew in the Greek. This has led to speculation among scholars that originally there were only two Kekropidai and that Herse was a later addition to the myth functioning essentially as a double of Pandrosos. The purpose of the creation of the character of Herse would have been to bring the number of Kekropidai up to three so as to conform to the common trope of three sisters in Greek mythology in keeping with the Three Fates the Three Charites etc..   == Cult and worship ==   === Arrephoria === The Arrephoria was a night festival that took place during the Greek month of Skiraphorion at the height of summer in the honor of Athena and Aphrodite. The myth of the Kekropidai was inherently connected to the festival and could be taken as a mythic paradigm for a yearly ritual that was carried out by the Arrephoroi during this time. The Arrephoroi consisted of two young girls selected from Athens' aristocratic families by the Archon Basileus king archon/magistrate. After being selected these girls would live in a home on the Acropolis for the duration of a year in order to serve Athena; the end of their period of service would culminate in the Arrephoria where they would perform the initiation ritual that would signify their passage into the next stage of their lives. According to a description given by Pausanias the Greek geographer:  For a certain time the Arrephoroi have their living from the Goddess: and when the festival comes round they have to perform certain ceremonies during the night. They carry on their heads what Athena s priestess gives them to carry and neither she who gives it nor they who carry it know what it is she gives them. In the city not far from Aphrodite-in-the-Gardens is an enclosed place with a natural entrance to an underground descent; this is where the virgin girls go down. They leave down there what they were carrying and take another thing and bring it back covered up. They are then sent away and other virgin girls are brought to the Acropolis instead of them.  In this context the myth of the Kekropidai served as a warning for the consequences of disobedience to the Arrephoroi who were forbidden to look into the chests that they were given to carry on their heads. Pandrosos as the obedient daughter who obeyed Athena s commands served as a role model for the Arrephoroi who were expected to follow her example when carrying the ritual objects to the sanctuary of Aphrodite. It has been suggested in scholarship that Pandrosos  obedience was acknowledged in the form of sacrifices; according to an old Attic law whenever the sacrifice of a cow was made to Athena it was necessary to sacrifice a ewe to Pandrosos as well even outside of the time of the Arrephoria. The two disobedient daughters Aglauros and Herse were also acknowledged during the Arrephoria. It is generally accepted that the Arrephoroi themselves represented the two unfaithful Kekropidai. The nighttime descent of the Arrephoroi could be taken as a symbolic reenactment of the scene in which Aglauros and Herse fling themselves from the Acropolis after viewing the contents of the chest that Athena gave to them.   === Pandroseion === The Pandroseion was a sanctuary dedicated to Pandrosos located on the north side of the Acropolis just to the west of the Erechtheion a sanctuary dedicated to Erechtheus. It was an open-air precinct built in the shape of a quadrilateral and its principle feature was Athena's sacred olive tree. In the shade of the olive tree stood an altar to Zeus Herkeios Zeus of the Court. The southeast corner A door in the lower storey of the western wall of the Erechtheion provided direct access between the Pandroseion and the Erechtheion s interior; yet another doorway also connected the Pandroseion to the north porch of the Erechtheion. In this manner the Pandroseion could be considered an appendage of the larger Erechtheion perhaps fittingly considering the manner in which the myth surrounding Pandrosos intertwines with the tale of the birth of Erechtheus.   == Notes ==
The God of Abraham Praise is a Christian adaptation of the well known Jewish hymn "Yigdal" loosely translated and Christianised by the evangelist Thomas Olivers after a visit to the Great Synagogue of London in 1770. It was first published in 1772. The title of the hymn was based on a verse in the Book of Exodus: "I am the God of thy Father the God of Abraham". Exodus 3:6   == History == Olivers worked with John Wesley during the time that "The God of Abraham Praise" was written. During the time he often met with members of London's Jewish community. In 1772 Olivers was attending The Great Synagogue in London and heard Cantor Myer Lyon sing "Yigdal" in Hebrew during a service. Olivers then paraphrased and translated "Yigdal" into English and gave the hymn more of a Christian focus. He then asked Lyon if he could use the Jewish melody for the new hymn. Lyon gave him the music and Olivers named this hymn tune "Leoni" after Lyon. When he showed the new hymn to a friend he annotated each line with scriptural references from The Bible. "The God of Abraham Praise" was first published as a leaflet titled "A Hymn to the God of Abraham" in 1772. It was later published nationwide by Wesley in the Methodist hymnal "Sacred Harmony". The hymn later made it to the United States after being published in Joshua Leavitt's "The Christian Lyre". The hymn was composed by Olivers with thirteen verses however later reprints of the hymn omit a number of them with the majority of hymn books using four verses. In the early 20th century in the United States "The God of Abraham Praise" was often confused with "Praise To the Living God" another translation of "Yigdal" by Max Landsberg and Newton Mann. Several Presbyterian Baptist and UCC hymnals misattributed "The God of Abraham Praise" to them instead of Olivers due to William Gannett recasting the work to change the title from "Praise to the Living God" to "The God of Abraham Praise". A number of versions of Methodist hymnals also made the same error until the 1980s.   == Interfaith dialogue == The Judeo-Christian context of "The God of Abraham Praise" has caused the hymn to be used in interfaith services between Jews and Christians. It has been referred to as "the hymn born in a synagogue".   == See also == Yigdal In Christian Hymnals   == References ==
Hemlock Lake is one of the minor Finger Lakes. It is mostly located in Livingston County New York south of Rochester with a portion overlapping into Ontario County. Hemlock is a translation of the Seneca name for the lake O-neh-da Te-car-ne-o-di.   == Description == Hemlock Lake is seven miles 11 km long and approximately 0.5 miles 0.80 km wide along most of its uniform north-south length. It has a surface area of 1800 acres 7 km2 and maximum and mean depths of 91 feet 28 m and 45 feet 14 m respectively. Because the lake is a water source to Rochester shore development is restricted and size limits pertain to boats and outboard motors. A feature of the lake is its land-locked salmon. In addition the lake contains rainbow trout brown trout lake trout smallmouth bass largemouth bass rock bass chain pickerel brown bullhead yellow perch walleye and black crappie.   == History == The Seneca people used the lake and its surrounding area for hunting and fishing near the south end of the lake up until the late 1770s. In September of 1779 General John Sullivan and his army drove the natives away from the lake as part of the Sullivan Expedition. In the 1790s Hemlock Lake received its first white settlers. Most of these settlers were involved in the lumber industry and built their homes out of wooden slabs by the outlet which is located at the north end of the lake. For a time this place was known as "Slab City". The lake was used to float logs to Slab City in the summer months as well as to haul logs on the ice in the winter time. Over the years Hemlock Lake became populated with over one hundred cottages and five hotels. There were five large boats that sailed the lake in the 1800s including its first steam boat "The Seth Green". The lake was a popular summer vacation destination for the wealthy many of whom came from Rochester. In 1873 the City of Rochester decided the primary source of water for the city should come from Hemlock Lake due to the abundance and purity of the water. In 1876 the gravity fed pipeline connecting Hemlock Lake to Rochester was opened. Shortly after this the city began buying up large acreages around the lake which included many cottages and hotels. Property owners who refused to sell to the city became the subject of eminent domain. Including the land around Hemlock's sister lake Canadice Lake the city owned over 5000 acres 20 km2 of land 3900 acres 16 km2 of which were forested. In 2010 the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation DEC purchased both Hemlock and Canadice Lakes from the City of Rochester for $13.7 million. The State has pledged to keep the lakes forever wild. Public access to the lake is permitted and encouraged however boats are restricted to 17 feet 5.2 m in length and to outboard motors must be 10 horse-power or less.   == References ==  The Democrat and Chronicle Sunday Magazine November 21 1993 The Democrat and Chronicle Sunday Magazine August 8 2010   == External links == Hemlock Water Filtration City of Rochester Water Supply System

En plein air French pronunciation:  [   pl n    ] or plein air painting is a phrase borrowed from the French equivalent meaning "open in full air". It is particularly used to describe the act of painting outdoors also called French: peinture sur le motif "painting of the objects or what the eye actually sees" where a painter reproduces the actual visual conditions seen at the time of the painting. This method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules; those might create a predetermined look. En plein air can also be used to describe other activities where a person partakes in an outdoor environment.   == History == Artists have long painted outdoors but in the mid-19th century working in natural light became particularly important to the Barbizon school Hudson River School and Impressionists. The Newlyn School in England is considered another major proponent of the technique in the latter 19th century. The popularity of painting en plein air increased in the 1840s with the introduction of paints in tubes like for toothpaste. Previously painters made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil. The act of outdoor painting from observation has endured throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century.   == Equipment and challenges == It was during the mid-19th century that the box easel typically known as the French box easel or field easel was invented. It is uncertain who developed it but these highly portable easels with telescopic legs and built-in paint box and palette made it easier to go into the forest and up the hillsides. Still made today they remain a popular choice even for home use since they fold up to the size of a brief case and thus are easy to store. Challenges include the type of paint used to paint outdoors animals bugs onlookers and environmental conditions such as weather. Acrylic paint may harden and dry quickly in warm sunny weather and it cannot be reused. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the challenge of painting in moist or damp conditions with precipitation. The advent of plein air painting predated the invention of acrylics. The traditional and well-established method of painting en plein air incorporates the use of oil paint.   == Advocates == French impressionist painters such as Claude Monet Camille Pissarro and Pierre-Auguste Renoir advocated plein air painting and much of their work was done outdoors in the diffuse light of a large white umbrella. In the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in Russia painters such as Vasily Polenov Isaac Levitan Valentin Serov Konstantin Korovin and I. E. Grabar were known for painting en plein air. But enthusiasts of plein air painting were not limited to the Old World. American impressionists too such as those of the Old Lyme school were avid painters en plein air. American impressionist painters noted for this style during this era included Guy Rose Robert William Wood Mary DeNeale Morgan John Gamble and Arthur Hill Gilbert. In Canada the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson are examples of en plein air advocates.   == Notable "plein air" artists ==   == Images ==   == See also == Art colonies Heidelberg School   == References ==   == External links ==  Media related to Plein air at Wikimedia Commons

Shelley Davis October 18 1952   December 12 2008 was an American attorney and activist best known for her advocacy of rights and better working conditions for farm workers particularly child migrant and seasonal laborers.   == Activism == At the time of her death Davis served as deputy director of the advocacy group Farmworker Justice where she campaigned against a 2006 Environmental Protection Agency proposal that would have allowed humans to be exposed to pesticides as part of toxicity tests. Her work with Farmworker Justice also took her to the U.S. Supreme Court where she litigated the case of Bates v. Dow Agrosciences 544 U.S. 431 2005 in which Dow Agrosciences attempted to block 29 Texas peanut farmers from suing the company after a pesticide developed by Dow allegedly caused damages to the farmers' crops. Prior to working with Farmworker Justice Davis worked to reform the H-2A program which allows foreign nationals entry into the United States for temporary or seasonal agricultural work. The efforts of Davis and other labor advocates in monitoring a group of H-2A workers from the Caribbean allegedly being exploited by the Florida sugar cane industry served as the basis for the film H-2 Worker.

The Apportionment Act of 1792 1 Stat. 253 was an apportionment bill passed by the United States Congress on April 10 1792 and signed into law by President George Washington on April 14 1792. The law set the number of members of the United States House of Representatives at 105 effective with the 3rd Congress on March 4 1793 and established that a number of representatives would be allotted to each state based upon the population enumeration provided by the 1790 Census Earlier apportionment legislation had been approved by the House in February 1792 and the Senate in March 1792 but was vetoed by the President on April 5 1792. It was the first presidential veto of legislation in American history.   == Background == Article I Section 2 Clause 3 of the Constitution stipulates that the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives is to be effected on the basis of population.   == Text ==  An Act apportioning Representatives among the several States according to the first enumeration. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled That from and after the third day of March one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three the House of Representatives shall be composed of members elected agreeably to a ratio of one member for every thirty-three thousand persons in each state computed according to the rule prescribed by the constitution; that is to say: Within the state of New Hampshire four; within the state of Massachusetts fourteen; within the state of Vermont two; within the state of Rhode Island two; within the state of Connecticut seven; within the state of New York ten; within the state of New Jersey five; within the state of Pennsylvania thirteen; within the state of Delaware one; within the state of Maryland eight; within the state of Virginia nineteen; within the state of Kentucky two; within the state of North Carolina ten; within the state of South Carolina six; and within the state of Georgia two members. APPROVED April 14 1792.   == Legislative history == An earlier apportionment bill was vetoed by President George Washington on 5 April 1792 as unconstitutional marking the first use of the U.S. President's veto power. Washington made two objections in a letter to the House describing the reason for his veto. The first objection made in the letter was that the bill did not have a uniform ratio to reach the numbers of representatives to population set forth in the bill. Secondly the bill "allotted to eight of the States more than one for every thirty thousand" as delimited by Article I Section II of the United States Constitution. The next day the House attempted to override the President's veto but failed to reach the two thirds vote required and on 10 April efforts began to revise the bill a third time.   == Review == On March 26 the bill was presented to the President. There was great disagreement among Washington's advisors and therefore he called upon Edmund Randolph Thomas Jefferson Alexander Hamilton and Henry Knox to give him their opinions of the bill. Randolph and Jefferson both said as the bill established the total number of representatives 120 by dividing the aggregate of the federal census by 30000 it was unconstitutional. The Constitution required they argued the choice of a common divisor and the division of the population residing in each state by that number to establish the size of the United States House of Representatives. Also because the bill gave an additional member to the eight states with the largest fraction left over after dividing by 30000 was according to Randolph "repugnant to the spirit of the constitution". Jefferson urged that Washington veto it because it was unconstitutional and introduced principles that were liable to be abused in the future. Contrary to Jefferson and Randolph both Knox and Hamilton urged that he approve the bill. Knox argued on 3 April that the Constitution was unclear about "whether the numbers of representatives shall be apportioned on the aggregate number of all the people of the United States or on the aggregate numbers of the people of each state." As the constitutionality of the bill was Knox said "only doubted not proved but the equity of the measure apparent it would appear rather a delicate measure for the President to decide the question contrary to the bill as passed." Hamilton wrote Washington on the following day that while he had not yet read the bill it seemed to him that the bill "performs every requisition of the constitution; and it will not be denied that it performs this in the manner most consistent with equality." Like Knox Hamilton believed that "In cases where two constructions may reasonably be adopted and neither can be pronounced inconsistent with the public good it seems proper that the legislative sense should prevail" and the bill should be signed into law.   == Veto == After considering both sides of the argument Washington decided that Jefferson and Randolph were correct and Washington agreed that the bill was unconstitutional. Even so Washington feared that by vetoing it he would increase geographical tensions by siding with the south as Jefferson and Randolph were both from Virginia. Further discussion with Randolph Jefferson and James Madison however allayed Washington's concerns and on 5 April the president decided to return the bill to the House of Representatives with the two objections that "there is no one proportion or divisor which applied to the respective numbers of the States will yield the number and allotment of representatives proposed by the Bill" and that "the Bill has allotted to eight of the States more than one [representative] for thirty thousand." Congress after receiving Washington's veto message the first in U.S. history threw out the original bill and decided on 10 April 1792 to apportion representatives at "the ratio of one for every thirty-three thousand persons in the respective States".   == See also == United States congressional apportionment Redistricting   == References ==   == Further reading == Celler Emanuel. 1952.

In the 1950s together with a variety of designs of dinghies Fairey Marine Ltd produced larger sailing cruisers the Atalanta named after Sir Richard's wife Titania and Fulmar also the 27' Fisherman motor sailer based on the Fairey Lifeboat hull. They also made the 15' Cinderella outboard runabout/ Carefree inboard runabout and the 16'6" Faun outboard powered family cruiser. Between 1956 and 1968 Fairey Marine produced some 291 Atalanta class sailing yachts designed by Uffa Fox: The Atalanta was conceived in 1955 by Alan Vines a senior executive at Fairey with the expertise of Uffa Fox who was their Design Consultant. It was envisaged as a trailable shallow draft performance cruiser with the sea keeping capabilities and safety of a fin keel yacht. Over the succeeding decades the distinctive centre cockpit design with its rolled decks and generous accommodation has more than fulfilled expectations offering a respectable turn of speed in light airs while her retractable cast iron keels give outstanding heavy weather performance in a seaway. Robust enough to carry its full sail in winds up to force five the Atalanta retains many of the handling characteristics of a classic dinghy. Fairey Marine went on to produce three variants of the Atalanta another 26 ft 8.1m hull with a slightly shorter cockpit and more headroom called the Titania named after another Fairey flying boat a larger version -the Atalanta 31 9.45m- and the Fulmar a 20 ft6.1m version with a single lifting keel. Small Dinghies were built using similar techniques as tenders for the larger boats.

On 29 May 1692 at Barfleur with only 45 ships he inflicted heavy losses on an English and Dutch fleet 97 ships strong but was forced to retreat. He himself suffered heavy losses after the battle when fire ships attacked the French ships of the line immobilised for repairs in Cherbourg. On 27 June 1693 he defeated a convoy of 59 English ships commanded by George Rooke at Cape St. Vincent near Lagos Bay in Portugal during the Battle of Cape St. Vincent.   == Honours and tributes ==  Tourville retired after the Peace of Ryswick and died in Paris on 23 May 1701 regarded as a national hero.

Vector Unit is a video game developer founded in December 2007 by Ralf Knoesel and Matt Small. The company is best known for its title Hydro Thunder Hurricane released on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade in 2010.   == History == Vector Unit was founded in December 2007 by Ralf Knoesel and Matt Small. The two originally worked together on Blood Wake at Stormfront Studios. Following Blood Wake Small took a job with EA Redwood Shores. Knoesel and Small kept in contact and started a small side project. One night Small received a message from Knoesel which read "So I've been having these thoughts... about quitting and doing the small games thing." The two decided to quit their job and begin their studio. Vector Unit was incorporated January 28 2008. Although officially the company consists of only two employees a team of five contractors were brought in to complete their first title Hydro Thunder Hurricane. Creative Director Matt Small was interviewed on the difficulties off starting a new company by Gamasutra in April 2010. Small noted that with a small team members are required to take on multiple roles. "You get to choose at least 80 percent of the time which hats you wear and then sometimes you end up forced into wearing a particular hat."   == Technology == Vector Unit uses a proprietary engine known as the Vector Engine to develop their games. The engine allows for real time "baking" of assets; when assets are first run in the game they are optimized for that particular platform. Visual scripting is used to allow editors to write scripted events without a comprehensive understanding of code. FMOD is used for audio and Bullet Physics Library handles all in-game physics. 3D models are created in Maya and artists are able to see how the asset would look in-game via a plugin. Level construction and placement of props are done in BarracudaEditor the team's level design tool. During the development of Hydro Thunder Hurricane Vector Unit maintained a PC build of the game which allowed artists and other team members to test their assets in-game without moving to a Xbox 360 Debug Kit.   == Games developed == 2010   Hydro Thunder Hurricane for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade Windows 8 via Windows Store 2011   Riptide GP for Android iOS BlackBerry 10 2012   Shine Runner for Android iOS BlackBerry 10 2012   Beach Buggy Blitz for Android iOS BlackBerry 10 2013   Riptide GP 2 for Android iOS BlackBerry 10 Xbox One PlayStation 4 2014   Beach Buggy Racing for Android iOS Xbox One PlayStation 4   == References ==   == External links == Official website

Luther Atwood November 7 1820   November 5 1868 was an American chemist. His notoriety stems from his inventions for distilling coal and petroleum into new products.   == Early life == Atwood was born at Bristol New Hampshire on November 7 1820. He was the eldest son of Jonathan and Huldah Gurdy Atwood of English descent. His earliest American paternal ancestor was from Sanderstead England. That ancestor emigrated to America in the 1640s and settled in Boston.   == Mid life == Atwood was educated at the New Hampton Academy in that city of the state of New Hampshire. After graduating he taught at the school for a year. During this time Atwood took up an interest in chemistry and first experimented with a still in which he made a peppermint oil extract. He sold the product in Boston.   == Career ==  Atwood became an employee of Philbrick & Trafton chemical manufacturers of Boston in 1849. A year or so later the firm was reestablished as Philbrick Carpenter and Company. Atwood became a partner of this new company located at Waltham Massachusetts. They manufactured products that were distilled from coal tar. Atwood invented "coup oil" in 1852 which was the first oil extracted from coal. Atwood's "coup oil" a product of coal tar picric acid and benzole was used as a machinery lubricant especially in the railroad industry and factories. The company located at Waltham Massachusetts made 175000 gallons of the lubricant before it was discontinued in 1859. "Coup Oil" was named by Atwood after the coup d' tat that had just been carried out by Louis Napoleon who became Emperor of France in 1852. The odor of this new oil extract was repulsive and disagreeable. Because of this he lost interest in his new oil extract invention. Atwood then decided to distill and refine "Canada pitch" which was obtained from petroleum overflows around Petrolia Ontario in Canada. He refined the oil to obtain light and heavy oils. He refined the light oils to a water-white burning oil. The heavy oils he refined to a quality grade of paraffine lubricating oil. From the paraffine oil he obtained a solid white paraffine which melted at about 130  F 54  C. "Canada pitch" was of a limited supply so Atwood experimented with gas coals of the Ohio valley the albertite of New Brunswick the boghead mineral from Scotland Trinidad pitch and petroleum. He visited France and Germany in 1854 1855 and 1856 for the oil industry. He became superintendent of the Glasgow oil works in Scotland Geary Miller & Company where the boghead mineral was being processed under the Scottish chemist James Young. The oils made by Young known as "Bathgate naphtha" possessed an odor that was disagreeable to most people resulting in a prejudice against paraffine oils. Atwood succeeded in refining his process to produce an oil that was colorless odorless and burned in lamp wicks with brilliancy. Atwood went to New York in 1858 and became chemist of the Queens County Oil Works at Blissville in Long Island City in New York. In that year Atwood invented the "meerschaum process" for the distillation of coal and patented the "tobacco pipe still" or retort. This consisted of an open kiln of masonry holding from twenty-five to one hundred tons of coal or shale which was fired from the top. A canal led to a condenser at the bottom. a jet of steam provided a downward draught providing distillation of coal. Another process known as a "cracker patent" was invented by Atwood in 1860. Atwood and his brother William received gold medals from New York state and Pennsylvania. The patents were highly important at first but became worthless by the development of petroleum oil wells in Pennsylvania. Atwood became chemist and superintendent of the Union Coal and Oil Company of Maysville Kentucky in 1866. This company owned a coal mine at Cannelton West Virginia. The coal was distilled in retorts at the mine and the crude oil obtained was carried to Maysville. There the crude was refined and lubricating oil was the main product.   == Patents == 1853   "Improvement in preparing lubricating-oils" US9630 A = "Coup oil" 1853   Improvement in processes for purifying alcohol US 9951 A 1859   "Improvement in apparatus for destructive distillation" US 23337 A 1860   "Improvement in construction of apparatus for the redistillation of coal-oils" US 28246 A   == Family == Atwood was married in Waltham Massachusetts on 1 January 1857 to Catherine Lucy daughter of Thomas J. Marsh. They had three children whose names were Charles E. Luther and Isabelle L.

The first coal oil factory to manufacture coal oil from coal tar was started in 1853 by the U.S. Chemical Manufacturing Company in Waltham MA. The light fractions from this coal oil distillation were called coal oil and used for illuminating purposes. The oil made in connection with picric acid benzol and other products from coal tar was named Coup Oil by Luther Atwood the inventor. When Edwin Drake demonstrated in 1859 that petroleum could be secured by drilling the coal oil industry died a natural death.  White 1891.

Louis Fran ois F lix Musnier de La Converserie 18 January 1766   16 November 1837 became a general officer during the French Revolutionary Wars and led a division during the Napoleonic Wars. He joined the French Royal Army as an officer in 1781 after a spell in military school. Still a lieutenant in 1788 he enjoyed rapid promotion during the French Revolution. After serving as a general's aide he was assigned to fight rebels in the Vend e. Later he served as Adjutant General on two army staffs. In 1798 he was promoted to general of brigade for distinguished actions in Italy. In 1800 Musnier led a brigade at Marengo. After a period of relative inactivity in which he was promoted to general of division he was sent to command a division in Spain. He fought under Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey and Jean-Andoche Junot. In 1809 Louis Gabriel Suchet took command of the corps and led it to a remarkable string of victories. During this period Musnier commanded his division in numerous engagements. In 1814 he transferred to eastern France to fight the Austrians. Because he rallied to Napoleon Bonaparte during the Hundred Days he was retired from the army except for a brief period in 1831 1832. His surname is one of the Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe.   == Revolution == Born on 18 January 1766 at Longueville France Musnier entered the military school of Paris on 22 August 1780 as a gentleman cadet. On 4 January 1781 he was promoted to sous-lieutenant. He joined the Pi mont Regiment on 22 December 1782. He was elevated in rank to second lieutenant on 10 August 1788 adjutant-major on 15 September 1791 and captain on 1 March 1792. Musnier became an aide-de-camp to General Alexis Magallon de Lamorli re of the Army of the Rhine in July 1792. The following year he was assigned to the Army of the West to fight the War in the Vend e. On 27 March 1795 he was named chef de bataillon major of the 1st Battalion of the 106th Line Infantry Demi Brigade.  Musnier became chef de brigade colonel of the 187th Line Demi Brigade on 5 September 1795. He transferred on 25 June 1796 to command the 60th Line Demi Brigade. He was named Adjutant General on 18 July 1796. In this capacity he carried out the functions of the chief of staff for the Army of the North and the Army of Batavia until July 1798. Musnier joined the Army of Italy on 18 October 1798 and performed notable service in the capture of Novara on 5 December 1798. He was rewarded for this action by promotion to general of brigade on 17 December 1798. He was posted to the division of Jean Boudet for Napoleon Bonaparte's 1800 campaign in Italy. At the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800 his brigade consisted of the 9th Light and 30th Line Infantry Demi Brigades. Under the overall direction of Louis Desaix Boudet's troops arrived late in the afternoon. French soldiers defeated earlier in the day took heart and rallied behind Boudet's fresh troops. Led by the 9th Light the new French line pushed back the Austrians of the Michael Wallis Infantry Regiment Nr. 11 but recoiled when Austrian chief of staff Anton von Zach sent a brigade of crack grenadiers into the fight. Soon afterward Desaix led Boudet's division in a general attack. With perfect timing the French unleashed a ferocious bombardment of the grenadiers just as Fran ois Etienne de Kellermann's heavy cavalrymen charged into their flank. Although Desaix was killed the grenadier brigade was broken and Zach was captured. Subsequently the Austrians withdrew from the field conceding defeat. Still in the Army of Italy Musnier fought at the Battle of Pozzolo on 25 December 1800. He was deactivated on 23 September 1801 but assigned to command the 15th Military Division on 14 November that year.   == Empire ==   === Invasion of Spain ===  Musnier became a Member of the L gion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and a Commander of the L gion on 14 June 1804. He was promoted to general of division on 1 February 1805. The year 1807 found him employed in coast defence in France. At this time Napoleon made the unwise decision to seize Spain by force and expel King Charles IV and his royal family. Using various pretexts he introduced 70000 French troops into Spain. On 16 February 1808 the French armies seized control of a number of important places and soon afterward sent the Spanish ruling family to be detained in France. On 2 May 1808 Spain exploded in revolt against the French occupation forces initiating the Peninsular War. Among the first French forces in Spain Musnier commanded the 1st Division in the 24430-strong corps of Marshal Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey. His division numbered 9700 soldiers in 17 battalions. Ordered to put down the insurrection in Valencia Moncey reached that city on 26 June 1808 with 9000 troops. Two days later he assaulted the city in the Battle of Valencia. Repulsed with 1000 casualties Moncey abandoned the effort and fell back toward Madrid in early July. On 1 August the French evacuated Madrid and withdrew behind the Ebro River in northeast Spain. For Napoleon's second invasion of Spain Moncey's command was renamed the III Corps and reinforced to a strength of 37690 men. Musnier led the 2nd Division. In the first Siege of Zaragoza during the summer of 1808 the French attackers had been defeated. On 19 December 1808 Moncey began the second Siege of Zaragoza. For the effort the marshal massed 38000 infantry 3000 artillerists and sappers 3500 cavalry and 144 guns. The French were opposed by 34000 Spanish regulars 10000 militia and 160 guns. Musnier's 3544-man 2nd Division comprised three battalions each of the French 114th and 115th Line Infantry Regiments and two battalions of the Polish 1st Legion of the Vistula. The city had to be taken house by house against desperate resistance. After losing 10000 soldiers killed wounded or died of disease the French captured the city on 20 February 1809. The Spanish suffered even heavier losses including 34000 civilians dead mostly from disease.   === Fighting in Aragon ===  The III Corps now under General of Division Jean-Andoche Junot overran the southern part of Aragon after the fall of Zaragoza. However Spanish guerillas became active again forcing the French to abandon some districts. Since war with Austria was imminent Napoleon withdrew half of Aragon's occupation forces. At this time Junot was replaced in command by General of Division Louis Gabriel Suchet. A Spanish army under General Joaqu n Blake y Joyes appeared and threatened French control of Aragon. Suchet attacked the Spanish army in the Battle of Alca iz on 23 May 1809. The French army had 7292 infantry in 14 battalions 526 cavalry in six squadrons and 18 guns. Blake's force was made up of 8101 foot soldiers 445 horsemen and 19 artillery pieces. Musnier's 2nd Division included the same units as at Zaragoza plus one battalion of the 121st Line. General of Division Anne-Gilbert Laval's 1st Division only mustered four battalions. Blake deployed his troops on high ground in front of Alca iz. Laval probed the Spanish right flank then Suchet ordered Musnier to attack Blake's center. Musnier formed the five battalions of the 114th Line and the 1st Vistula Legion into a massive 2600-man column and launched it at Blake's line. All 19 Spanish guns played on this formation and musketry as well. Under this fire the French and Poles were halted and then fled. Suchet who was wounded immediately withdrew from the field. The III Corps suffered 800 casualties while Blake counted only 300 killed and wounded. The defeat caused Suchet to abandon much of Aragon while Blake was swamped by 25000 new recruits most of whom he could not supply with weapons. After his victory Blake advanced on Zaragoza with 20000 men divided into three divisions. He advanced down the Huerva River with one division on the right bank and two divisions on the left bank. Leaving Laval and a 2000-man brigade to observe the Spanish right bank division Suchet confronted Blake in the Battle of Mar a on 15 June 1809. The French general deployed Musnier on his right and General of Brigade Pierre-Joseph Habert's 1st Division brigade on his left. Suchet expected some troops to arrive later in the day and planned to stall for time. Blake struck at Musnier's division but the 114th Line beat back the attack with help from a Polish lancer regiment. Suchet ordered a counterattack but the combat was halted by a hail storm. At length the French reinforcements arrived and Suchet launched Habert and Pierre Watier's cavalry at Blake's right wing. The Spanish line crumbled but Blake was able to withdraw in relatively good order though he lost 16 of his 25 guns. The French and Poles lost 700 or 800 casualties out of 10000 infantry 800 cavalry and 12 guns. The Spanish suffered losses of 1000 killed 3000 to 4000 wounded and hundreds captured out of 14000 foot soldiers and 1000 horsemen. Musnier's division was the same as at Zaragoza with the addition of one battalion of the 2nd Reserve Legion.  On 18 June 1809 Blake made a stand in the Battle of Belchite. The Spanish army formed on some hills in front of the town of Belchite. Suchet paid no attention to Blake's center while sending Musnier to attack the Spanish left and Habert to assault the right. Musnier's troops made some progress driving back Blake's left wing. Just as Habert struck on the other flank a lucky hit blew up the Spanish ammunition stores. At this Blake's men panicked and fled the field. Suchet left Musnier to watch Blake's force and returned to Zaragoza to restore order in Aragon. The Spanish lost 2000 casualties out of 11000 infantry and 870 cavalry plus all nine of their artillery pieces. French losses were only 200 killed and wounded. Musnier spent the rest of the year pacifying the southern part of Aragon. He scored a few successes but the guerillas learned to avoid major concentrations of French troops. In January 1810 the 23140-man III Corps was organized into three infantry divisions under Laval Musnier and Habert and a cavalry brigade under General of Brigade Andr  Joseph Boussart. With 11 battalions and 7173 effectives Musnier's 2nd Division was the largest formation in the corps. Suchet planned to operate against Mequinenza and L rida. Instead King Joseph Bonaparte ordered him to advance against Valencia. Because Joseph's forces were in the process of overrunning Andalusia against spotty resistance the king believed that the Spanish armies were in a state of collapse. Reluctantly Suchet set out for Valencia and reached there on 6 March. He found its Spanish defenders full of fight and found it necessary to abandon the futile mission four days later. Back in Aragon Suchet spent some time suppressing guerillas before moving against L rida. He arrived before the city on 15 April. After finding that General Henry O'Donnell was marching to the city's relief Suchet took Musnier's division and went looking for the hostile army. The two forces missed each other and Musnier returned to the vicinity of L rida on the night of 22 April. The next morning Miguel Ibarrola Gonz les encountered Jean Isidore Harispe's small covering force east of L rida. Harispe called for help and when Musnier showed up with his division Ibarrola quickly fell back to the hamlet of Margalef with Musnier in aggressive pursuit. In the Battle of Margalef as the Spanish troops faced Musnier's infantry the 13th Cuirassier Regiment charged into their flank. Ibarrola's formations were cut to pieces. When O'Donnell appeared with a second division the French heavy cavalrymen overran his rear guard. Out of 5500 foot soldiers and 500 horsemen the French reported only 100 casualties all from the cuirassiers. O'Donnell lost 500 men killed and wounded plus 2000 soldiers and three guns captured out of a total of 7000 infantry 300 cavalry and six guns. In addition to the heavy cavalry Musnier's force included three battalions each of the 114th and 115th Line two battalions of the 1st Vistula Legion the 4th Hussars and two foot artillery batteries. The Siege of L rida ended with the French capture of the city in mid-May.   === Invading Valencia ===  Siege of Mequinenza lasted less than a month falling to Suchet on 5 June 1810. Musnier's division was involved in the operation. Its composition was the same as at L rida plus three battalions of the 121st Line. Musnier was appointed Grand Officer of the L gion d'Honneur on 28 August 1810. From 16 December 1810 to 2 January 1811 Musnier led his division in the Siege of Tortosa which ended in a Spanish surrender. His division's organization was the same as at Mequinenza except that the 1st Light replaced the 115th Line. Musnier was named Baron of the Empire on 20 January 1811. Musnier missed the Siege of Tarragona in May and June 1811. A muster roll from 15 July 1811 showed his 1st Division to number 7689 men in 11 battalions. He fought at the Battle of Saguntum on 25 October. His 4829-man division consisted of brigades under Louis Beno t Robert and Florentin Ficatier. After the battle he was briefly responsible for defending Aragon before he rejoined the main army. He led his division at the Siege of Valencia in December 1811 and January 1812. This operation resulted in the capitulation of Blake with 16270 men and 374 guns. The 1st Division was made up of three battalions each of the 114th and 121st Line and two battalions each of the 1st and 2nd Vistula Legions. At the Battle of Castalla on 13 April 1813 Robert commanded the 1st Division in Musnier's absence. In June 1813 Musnier's division included 4163 men in seven battalions. This unit missed the Battle of Ordal on 13 September 1813. By late 1813 Musnier's division had shrunk to 3561 troops in six battalions.   === Late Empire === In late 1813 Musnier was recalled to France where he inspected fortresses. On 23 December he was given command of the Geneva reserve. In January 1814 he was attached to Marshal Pierre Augereau's command which was based at Lyon. With 6000 men he sparred with Ferdinand Graf Bubna von Littitz's forces. On 17 February he fought a skirmish with Joseph Klopstein von Ennsbruck's Austrians. On 11 March 1814 he was defeated at M con by Frederick Bianchi Duke of Casalanza and 8000 Austrians. His rather motley force of 6000 men included elements of the 32nd Light and 20th 23rd and 67th Line Infantry Regiments 13th Cuirassiers 12th Hussars and National Guard of Toulon. The French lost 800 killed and wounded plus 500 men and two guns captured. Austrian losses were 450 killed and wounded and 450 captured.   == Retirement == Musnier accepted the return of King Louis XVIII who awarded him the Order of Saint Louis on 27 June 1814. During the Hundred Days he transferred his allegiance to Napoleon who gave him responsibility for the 10th 11th and 20th Military Divisions on 28 May 1815. He was retired from the army in September and remained so for 15 years. He was placed in the reserve on 17 February 1831 and his final retirement occurred on 1 March 1832. He died in Paris on 16 November 1837. MUSNIER is engraved on the Western pillar on Column 37 of the Arc de Triomphe.   == References ==   == Bibliography == Arnold James R. 2005.

Raj BhavanTamil:               Tamil Nadu literally the "Governor's Palace" is the official residence of the Governor of Tamil Nadu. It is located in Chennai the capital city of Tamil Nadu.   == History == The earliest official residence of the Governors of Madras were in Fort St. George the first one built in the 1640s on what is now the Parade Square. This was pulled down in 1693 and a new one built eastwards where in later years it became the core of the Secretariat. When the Governor s garden house was destroyed by the French in 1746 a new garden house was acquired for the Governor after the French withdrawal in 1749. A house which belonged to Antonia de Madeiros a member of perhaps the richest family of the time became the core of Government House around which developed what is now called Government Estate. It was in the 1820 that Governor Thomas Munro 1820 1827 made Government House the official residence and now it called as Raj Bhavan and was once Guindy Lodge the Governor s country house. Guindy Lodge it is believed was built by Governor William Langhorne 1672 1678 in the early 1670s in garden space carved out of the Guindy Forest that had helped make St. Thomas  mount a salubrious place for rest and recreation. When Langhorne left in 1678 he sold the property to the then Chief Merchant of Madras Beri Chinna Venkatadri the younger brother of one of the founders of the city Beri Thimappa.

The Civic Guard Mutiny also known as the Kildare Mutiny was the first of two major security force mutinies in the early years of the Irish Free State. It involved the Garda S och na the police force of the newly independent Free State and took place in May 1922 in the Kildare Depot the training depot for the force's recruits. It was followed in 1924 by the better-known Army Mutiny. The mutiny occurred in the aftermath of the Anglo-Irish War. The Garda had been set up to replace the Royal Irish Constabulary RIC the force responsible for policing all of Ireland outside Dublin during British rule. The RIC had been a major part of the British effort during the conflict which saw many of its members killed or intimidated from their homes. The majority of RIC men left the Free State when British withdrawal became apparent many to serve in the Royal Ulster Constabulary the RIC's successor in the newly created Northern Ireland. While most recruits to the Garda came from the ranks of the Irish Republican Army which had fought against the RIC about 100 ex-RIC men became part of the new force. Many of these had spied for or otherwise assisted the IRA during the conflict. Because of their experience in police work some of these men were used to train the new Garda recruits. Problems became apparent when some recruits would not conceal their dislike of the ex-RIC instructors and refused to salute them. On 15 May 1922 over 1200 recruits broke ranks during Morning Parade seized the armoury and took over the Depot. Commissioner Michael Staines and senior officers withdrew under armed guard and the mutineers elected County Clare IRA commander and Sinn F in TD Patrick Brennan as their commissioner. Negotiations between the mutineers and the Provisional Government of Ireland over control of the force lasted seven weeks during which time the Irish Civil War had begun. Staines resigned in September and was replaced by Eoin O'Duffy. Brennan resigned his D il seat in December and was subsequently appointed Assistant Commissioner. Tensions in the run-up to the Civil War were also contributing factors in the mutiny as leading figures in the Anti-Treaty IRA encouraged their followers to join the Garda with a view to destabilising it. Senior Garda  also manipulated the mutineers for their own ends.   == References ==

The Montells were an American garage rock band from Miami Florida who were active in the 1960s. They briefly operated under the name H.M. Subjects and recorded a version of the Pretty Things's "Don't Let Me Down" which while in the process of becoming a local hit became embroiled in a controversy involving Morton Downey Jr. then a disc jockey at Miami's WFUN and later of talk show fame. The song was criticized for its apparently sexually suggestive lyric and the contention that Downey allegedly took payola for the song an allegation which was never proven. The band went on to record another single once again as the Montells featuring an A-side for which they are remembered "You Can't Make Me." They broke up in 1967 but would reunite for a performance in 2008.   == History ==   === Origins === The Montells began as the Impalas in 1963 and were made of up students from Southwest Senior High School in Miami Florida.  In the 1960s the school served as a major breeding ground for Miami's thriving rock scene and hosted a number of fellow garage bands such as Evil and the Shaggs and had earlier been the Alma Mater of Charlie McCoy who had by then become one of the most in-demand session musicians in Nashville playing with a number of famous artists including Bob Dylan. The lineup of the Impalas consisted of John Weatherford on rhythm guitar George Walden on lead guitar George Hall on bass and Jeff Allen on drums. They would occasionally bring in Gene Murray as a part time vocalist. Walden and Weatherford had taken classical guitar lessons and Hall had played bass in the school band. The two would get to together and hold rehearsals in the afternoon. Jeff Allen lived in the neighborhood and asked them if he could join. They told him that he could under the condition that he by a drum kit. Allen purchased a drum kit that had the logo of another band "the Impalas" printed on it so they just decided to use the name Impalas. The band played for about a year as a largely instrumental surf group often playing at parties. Eventually the group was threatened with a lawsuit over their use of the name "the Impalas" so they re-christened themselves as the Montells. According to Carter Ragsdale "...on the way to get the bass drum painted we passed a dance studio called the House of Montell. We thought that would be a good name so we became the Montells." In 1964 the Montells enlisted Carter Ragsdale to be their lead singer who was recommended by Gene Murray who was departing. The band would increasingly tailor their sound to fit the kind of hard rocking blues-based approach of British bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Animals." Drummer Jeff Allen later to play with Evil would make occasional trips with this family to England and when there would check out many of the hottest bands such as the Fairies Downliners Sect and the Pretty Things and upon his returns would bring back records and share his observations with fellow bandmates.   === H. M. Subjects and controversy ===  In May 1965 the Montells went to Dukoff Recording Studios in Miami to record several songs amongst which "Don't Bring Me Down" previously recorded by British group the Pretty Things would be featured on their first single released on Blue Saint Records. Upon the release of this record and in live performances around this time the Montells temporarily operated under the name H.M. Subjects short for "Her Majesty's Subjects at the request of a disc jockey at the local radio station WFUN who wanted them to adopt a name that would appeal to fans of British Invasion groups such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The deejay was none other than Morton Downey Jr. later of talk show fame who was known in Miami at the time as "'Doc' Downey" or sometimes "the Liverpool Loudmouth" and was a transplant who had originally worked at WONE in Dayton Ohio and later at KDEO in San Diego and had been involved in the music industry at times as a musical act himself or in production and A&R such as with his brief stint at Magic Lamp Records in Los Angeles where he had been involved with surf rock records by the Chantays and the Surfaris. At the time it was not uncommon for deejays to host dances and guitarist George Walden and drummer Jeff Allen would frequently visit WFUN and got to know the staff there. The lyrics of H.M. Subjects' version of the song were somewhat improvised by vocalist Ragsdale and contained sexually suggestive lines such as "and when I laid her on the ground." After hearing an acetate of "Don't Let Me Down" the opportunistic Downey quickly realized the potential to create a publicity scandal. He became involved with the release of the record and the band's promotion. The record became a local hit climbing up the Miami charts to #5. Just as soon as the record was ascending to the top of charts it became engulfed in controversy as parents objected to the song's sexual connotations declaring it a "dirty record" and tried to have it banned. A censored version was released with the word "laid" replaced by a tone-generated beep but it failed to quell the controversy perhaps making the negative reaction even worse by inadvertently drawing even more attention to the suggestiveness of the lyric especially when played on the radio where listeners could complete the ad lib for themselves sometimes in ceremonious fashion. Some have even speculated that the censor beeps were inserted by Downey himself. While Downey succeeded in creating the scandal he craved he became the center of another but less amenable controversy. It was reported that he had a financial interest in all of the records he had played at WFUN receiving a one cent proceed from every disc sold and the H.M. Subjects' record came under the lion's share of the scrutiny. WFUN conducted an investigation into the allegations but could not come up with sufficient evidence so Downey returned to his Monday slot. Downey nonetheless became involved this time in a scandal involving an acrimonious situation involving the top deejay at rival station WQAM. WFUN was now concerned that their F.C.C. license might revoked. To placate the stations' concerns and avoid termination Downey suspended sale of the H.M. Subjects' record effectively letting it die in the charts. However the scandal involving his actions towards the deejay at WQAM resulted in Downey's eventual firing at WFUN. According to music writer Jeff Lemlich:  If there were any real losers in this battle royale no doubt it was our boys from Southwest High. First the Montells were deprived of a number one hit when copies of "Don't Let Me Down" were left to waste away in the warehouse. Their planned second release through Downey Van Morrison's "Gloria" was also put on hold.   === Continued recording and activity as the Montells === The band returned to using their former name the Montells and remained a popular local act continuing to play dances and armories and enjoyed a regional following traveling to Gainesville to play at the University of Florida playing in venues such as a club in Winter Haven owned by Gram Parsons' father and Daytona's Surf Club. In 1965 Danny Murphy replaced George Hall on bass and would also contribute lead and backing vocals as well as occasional guitar to the band's arrangements. In 1966 Don Ricketts who had played in fellow Miami band the Modds would briefly join the group as a second bass player to provide additional support when Murphy was on guitar. The band went into the studio to record what has become perhaps their best known song "You Can't Make Me" backed with an Otis Blackwell penned chestnut "Daddy Rolling Stone" previously covered by the Who and released on the Themes label in May 1966. That year drummer Jeff Allen left to join Evil and was replaced by Ted Napoleon." In 1967 lead singer Carter Ragsdale was drafted into the army during the Vietnam conflict. Former bassist George Hall also served time in Vietnam as well as John Mascaro of fellow Miami band the Modds. The Montells broke up in 1967.   === Later developments === Carter Ragsdale and Steve Chase briefly started a group named Carter's Pills with Ragsdale on vocals Chase on guitar and Billy Demoya on organ playing at venues such as the Armory and the Place in North Miami. Later Ragsdale would follow his father's footsteps as a horse trainer. The Montells re-united briefly with three of their 1960s members Ragsdale Weatherford and Hall augmented by Johnny Dalton previously of Evil on guitar and for Dewey Bond formerly in the Modds on drums for a Miami appearance at Geezerpalooza in 2008. In the intervening years following their breakup the Montells' work has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts. In 2002 Corduroy Records released a split album featuring the work of both the Montells and Evil entitled The Montells/ Evil. The song "You Can't Make Me" is included on the Back from the Grave Volume 2 CD CD and the Back from the Grave Volume 3 LP LP put out by Crypt Records.   == Membership ==   === 1963-1964 as the Impalas === John Weatherford rhythm guitar George Walden lead guitar George Hall bass Jeff Allen drums Gene Murray occasional vocals   === 1964-1965 as the Montells and H.M.
